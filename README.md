This script parses all of the paths contained in wikiPaths.txt to create a array of paths proceeding the extension https://www.familysearch.org/en/wiki/. The script automates each page using the paths to create a full URL to access the page, and creates a custom-made json file containing audit results of each page listed in the .txt file.

What's being done:

audit-all: Each audit takes the full url generated by the initial script, opens a headless chrome window, navigates to that url, and enacts a lighthouse audit, focusing only on accessibility, and returns the audit. The script next extracts all relevant data from the returned json object and returns a new json object containing only what's relevant. This json object is written to the audit-results folder, where it's given the name of the path.

audit-single: Takes a single url and produces the json output for that page's report. Used for individual audits and testing.

compare: Compares all audits within old-audit-results to the audits in audit-results and produces a json file in audit-comparisons for each page that details what all were different between audits. 

This json object's data will be used to further automate improvements for each of these wiki pages.
