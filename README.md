Lighthouse Automation Script
Version 1.1.0
Created by Jarod Day

Usage: node runConcurrentAudits.mjs <numberOfConcurrentAudits>

This script will parse all of the paths contained in wikiPaths.txt to create a array of paths proceeding the extension https://www.familysearch.org/en/wiki/. Using the paths, the script automates each one and creates a json file containing audit results of each page listed in the .txt file

What's being done:

Each audit takes the full url generated by the initial script, opens a headless chrome window, navigates to that url, and enacts a lighthouse audit, focusing only on accessibility, and returns the audit. The script next extracts all relevant data from the returned json object and returns a new json object containing only what's relevant. This json object is written to the audit-results folder, where it's given the name of the path.

This json object's data will be used to further automate improvements for each of these wiki pages.
